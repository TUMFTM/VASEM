# VASEM
Vehicle concept development for Autonomous, Shared and Electric Mobility


  
## Running the Model/Code

To start the simulation, you have to run the GUI  
```
Start.mlapp
```

The GUI of the tool steps are shown in the following figure. The numbers will explain its functionality.

### START
```
Start.mlapp
```
